_**See [Get Free Video Game](get-free-game) for the introduction.**_

The point of the game, don’t forget is to move you through the game of life, the matrix, in ORDER to reveal to you where you’re still not free. And based on the hermetic principle of as within so without, everything being a reflection of your current state, the game itself will manifest and be reflected differently as you change.

**Systems:**

- Chakras
- Astrology/Human Design?
- Lunar Calendar
- Somatic Therapy / Exercises
- Peter Crone Framework

**Brainstorm**

There could be many levels for each player. Instead of how much he owns (have) the game is based on how much he is (be). And one measure of that could be via the Chakra System, such as:

- **Root** - survival, HAVE, physical
- **Sacral -** desires, creation,
- **Solar** - will over matter, DO
- **Heart -**
- **Throat -**
- **Third Eye -**
- **Crown -**

Gene Keys System

Moving from the Shadow to the Gift and or Siddhi throughout the whole game, as you surrender the control and trust more and more in the Higher Self.

**Privilege System in current society**

It Monopoly every one starts at the same square, but rarely in life it is like that. We all benefit of some degree of privilege over others. Should this be reflected?

---

There is an **“Oracle”** deck of cards, which are really there to guide the player.

They have a choice when they stumble on “Guidance” to pick an Oracle card or to ask their Higher Self directly – but for that they have to have a good connection with their Higher Self - which is in connection with all of the other Higher Selves and can actually guide them.

So one form to strengthen the connection with the Higher Self is by accumulating Karma Points or some sort of Points, or just the level you’re at in the Chakra system.

I like the Karma Points as well - as Karma Yoga. Instead of money you accumulate Karma Points?

This sounds good in theory but it would revert to the same form of mentality as with real money, you just live now in order to accumulate more and more points.

You just give in order to get pretty much, and that’s not the way, and what I want to promote with this game.

**Bonus Online**

A great bonus of this is that it can be played online as well of course, with camera involving the technology I built for Chessroulette including Movex. Maybe it wasn’t about chess all along but about something new that still aligns with where with my soul and with all of the skills and gifts I received.

- design
- coding
- wanting to build a game
- that aligns with my soul
- that could help others
- that can be played in real life
- all of the practices and systems I familiarized myself with
- my own healing journey
- inspiration to be a coach

**Game Play**

---

The game is playable in 2 to 4 (can it be more) plus a Higher Self person, similar to Monopoly, where there was a banker.

The Higher Self knows all of their Karma Cards, and what they are all going through but s/he cannot divulge to any one else during the game.

So first, everyone picks a card, aka the Karma Card. This will be the Card that will give them their privilege level, their history - traits, trauma, conditioning and shadow, gifts, etc, and also what they are to work on in this lifetime. In a more simplified term it will give them their Shadows and Gifts they came here to work on.

In the online setting this can also be helped by getting their birth date and time to infer their Astral Chart + Human Design + Gene Keys + Tzolkin. But this is next level.

They cannot see this card during the game, only their Higher Self Player can.

The Game is based on the truth that everyone is a free, powerful, boundless, limitless being that has forgotten and the game helps reveal that, so they can “Get Free.”

Each Turn, represents a new day for each one of them. Here we can get deeper into Tzolkin, Numerology, Lunar Calendar and other systems that track time and can talk about the energy of the day, but this could overwhelm new players. This could be added as an extended pack.

**Game Play Ideas**

The Game focuses on the interaction between players, much more than Monoply does, as the point is not to accumulate more in separation from each others but to get free together.

**The Journey Spot**

It gives the player the chance to take a journey into his psyche via different methods

- Plant Medicine
- Coaching
- Dream Work
- Ceremonies
- etc

Or it can be named the **Know Thyself Spot**

Where you get to reflect using different techniques either individually or in pair/group

- Somatic Coaching
- Peter Crone

When you pick your Karma Card, it has to faces actually - one for the lower self, and one for the Higher Self. And it would be amazing to make it available to be combined therefore to make each game unique.

For example instead of:

Picking one card out of the 10 prisons such as:

- I’m not enough
- I’m not loveable
- I’m don’t matter
- I’m not worthy
- My needs don’t matter
- etc.

You pick a combination, that for the lower self will simply be written in more 3d, practical terms, aka the Stories such as:

- _“I don’t have money”_
- _“I can’t hold a relationship”_
- _“I’m bad at my job”_
- _“I get bullied all the time”_
- etc

this are the stories the ego tells us, because at this level it’s the ego that talks.

This are literally endless and can be extended

But each story has an upside - the truth, that you cannot see yet because it sits in your blindspot, but the Higher Self can. It’s important for the Higher Self to be able to, in order to guide you when you chose to, but not always will your higher self be available (in some games there are not enough people so you rely on the Oracle or others means, which can still work their magic)

On the other side of the story, sits the truth. This are more limited, with different flavors, but they are the thematics.

So for example the story “I don’t have money” has the prison of “I’m not worthy” and is thus in that theme – this can be reflected by a different color.

Each theme has a different color, and they are limited.

So, in the game play, when a player picks his Karma Cards - this card will have a theme, so the Higher Self will know the theme in which this person is in, and has access to it. The HSP has access to the theme specifics such as, general definition, type of answer, questions they can give them based on the level (chakra/karma points) they are at, etc.

For example, if a person is at the level of Solar Plexus, still identified with the Ego, but having made some progress, in the realm of Doing, not Having, when he seeks guidance from the Higher Self on how to resolve this issue (because the issue affects the game play btw) the HSP can answer based on the level the player is at only!

Yes, btw - the issues they come with, define in the Karma Card, are imposing a cost on the game play. For example a person who has money issues, will lose money at each turn or something alike every time you hit this spot you pay someone else money, until it gets resolved and you move up a level from your Shadow to the Gift.

**Questions**

**What does a general slot represent? What can you do when you stumble on it?**

Maybe the whole journey is about a day in someone’s life. With daily routines, with unpredictables, with work, with relationships, etc.
