**What?**

A game named _“Get Free”_ inspired by Peter Crone’s work. Imagine you play as your Higher Self and what you see on the screen is you in this life, your lower-case self, which is still driven by the ego, by the patterns, conditionings and prisons. 

The way to interact with your character is very limited in the beginning, as you cannot control his free will, so you need to find ways in the outside (coincidences, reflections, etc) or on the inside (a memory, a dream, a deja vu). The character lives under the assumption that what he needs to do is live the perfect standard life of a human in the 21 century (go to work, have a family, raise kids, climb up the ladder, maybe have some hobbies in the spare time and if possible create something unique but that’s it) and your job, as his Higher Self is to influence his journey on different path - the path of Knowing Thyself - which can become the path of healing, the path of serving, the path of inquiring, the path of enlightment, etc.

As the game progresses the control over the character, if he starts opening up, will increase moving from simple influences on the outside or inside to literally taking the wheel at times, as he now trusts that is not the Ego that needs to drive but his Higher Self.

**What’s the point of the Game? Where does it go, end?**

- To become one with the character?!
- To be able to move freely and do all of the cool things inside the world around that they wanted but never had the possibility to, etc.

**What’s the message of the Game?**

- to give a different perspective to the player, on what his life is about
- to open the player up to new possibilities
- to see life in a different, more spiritual way

**Brainstorms**

Also, the players, when starting can put their real date of birth because therefore they can get the a personalized game based on their Astral Chart, Gene Keys and Human Design for example. As well as Tzolkin Calander. And then certain themes from their life could actually appear and be relevant in the game. 

I believe here we need to involve AI.

The name “Get Free” could also symbolize the get free from the matrix

Another beautiful idea we can use is the Lunar Calendar as part of the time keeping inside the game
