## Ideas/ Our Forest DAO

#### Status - Brainstorm

**What?**

An organization that protects forests in Romania by buying them before getting cut down and transforming them into wild life refugees, protected by law.

If we cannot stop them, if the laws don’t work in the people and nature’s favor, if the corruption got so deep that the light cannot be seen anymore, and the people involved so disconnected from their own hearts and from nature itself, maybe the last thing we can do besides becoming ourselves guardians and stewards of the nature and fostering a right relationship with the Mother Earth and allow others to see us in our truth, we can also buy the land and put a fence around it, not to guard and say it’s mine, but to protect it.

**Why?**

Because the forests are being cut at extreme rates at the moment, the ecosystems aren’t protected, the animals are dying. There is a lot of corruption and a whole mafia there. Romania is the last place in Europe that still boasts a high percentage of land covered in forests, and is home to the last virgin forests as well.

It is not only devastating to see it been cut down, but also a big loss for everyone in the world, as well as for our ability to maintain the fragile balance of the world ecosystems and global climate chaos.

**How?**

A DAO, or Decentralized Autonomous Organization, where people don’t just donate to our organization but actually own their own piece of the forest.

Our job is to find the forests, raise money to buy them through the DAO, buying it and protecting it by collaborating with many like minded individuals and organizations such as Agent Green.

I think with good smart promotion and incentives we can appeal to wealthy individuals.

In the long term, once the DAO is established we can also create a token/coin that is based on the amount of trees in the DAO. The more trees the more valuable the coin, thus promoting owning more forests.

Just like a coin would be backed by gold, this is backed by the Green Gold. We could even make a case of the amount CO2 absorbed by our forests and leverage that angle too in order to increase the coin’s value.

There are many things that can be done as a DAO and we’re only touching the surface but I think this is a good start.
