I call for poetry, for living on the line, for words that are inspired from action, from lived facts not mere imagination or the lives of others.
I call for verses that bleed with me, because they bleed from me.
I call for truth, for a life that is worth living, fighting and resisting for a cause bigger than me.

In 2026 I open my heart, fully to the world, with all its ugliness and hardness. I don't call for pain and hurt but I am open to it too if it's needed. This is the year I stop hiding in my castle, this is the year I bleed with everyone else. The times are calling for a change in many ways–it is my opportunity to pick one. I get to choose the one most worthy for my Soul and take action for, that is the privilege I have.

That to me is the trees of Transilvania. The stopping of the exploitation of the forests for the benifit of profiteering for big corporations.

When the mind doesn't bother, trust the heart:

> Warrior of light
>
> time to fight
>
> for what you believe in.
>
> Time to stand!

And from this stance everything will come together: partnership, community, family, descendants.
_To bring upon this world honorable descendants you first need to be an honorable ancestor._

This year breads action, through hard earned legacy.

I call for a life worth living.
I call for peaceful evenings where I can lay down my head to rest, because I know I gave it all and gave myself whole to my purpose, my mission.

I pray-in aligned action, rooted in my bones, beating with the rhythm of my heart.

I see hard times with long days working and walking towards; my grand mission: making _moves that matter_, but easy nights where sleep caresses the tired and beaten body.

I get to choose what I want:

- easy days and hard nights where sleep escapes my reach
- or hard days but easy nights where my being is at ease knowing I acted in coherence with my Soul.

I get to choose my hard. Each day is a new choice to make and the choices I make determine the arch of my life experience and the legacy I leave behind.
