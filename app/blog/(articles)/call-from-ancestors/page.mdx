I write this with the ancestors in my thoughts, present in my being. May what passes through be heard as it is to be spoken. 
This is their voice, for all of you who stumble upon this writing. 

For too long have we endured, sitting silent and waiting in your bones & in your tissues. 
For too long have we been patient, hoping for the right time or for better times to emerge on their own.

But the truth, as you can now feel it too, is that you are the bringer of change. You have our full support, but you are the one to do it–it is your responsibility. And it is not a small one, for that we give you gifts.

You have our wisdom, our support and our vision.
YOu have others like you that have come for this as well. 

Unite! 

Call to each other and hear the calling. It is us calling for change through your voices. It is our voices. Hear them. Listen to them. Honor them. And most of all, use them as support in the times to come. Use our songs, our soothings, our spells to aid your pain and caress your tender souls, but forge on your own path, your own destiny, your own world. It is yours and your children!

It is a blank page as ours has been in our time. Use it well but use it nevertheless. The greatest shame of all is leaving it empty, too scared to make a mistake. There is no mistake in art. Each breath is a stroke of perfection to the poet. For that is needed too–art, poetry: to keep the heart warm and open. But use it, use it to ignite the fires of action, of resistence, of pushing forward away from the obedient complecency towards stagnant uniformity of thought, behavior and persona until the point of becoming undistinguishable from one another that you are pushed into. What kind of monoculture like that survices the harsh times of evolution? None! For it will be forsaken with the passing of ages. Stagnancy does not breed life, it only heralds death.

In bio-diversity of culture, of thought, of body, of tradition, of songs and dances, of joys and sorrows, of habits and tools to you stand a chance in font of the hard changes of life. 

In that unite! If you let go of you armour you'll see you are more alike than different!
