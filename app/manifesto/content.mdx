**I believe the world as we know it is coming to an end.**

And we can choose to do something about it, to mitigate the impact its collapse will have on us.

**Why do I say this?**

Well, among the data points telling me this, I list the followings:

- people are obsessed with buying new things.
    - Those things are produced at mass scale, without real concern for recycling, reusing, repairing or refurbishing them
- there is a tendency to go big: buy big, build big, drive big
- families or communities of the old generations are almost inexistent nowadays
  - we don't know our neighbors
  - people don't even go out in the villages anymore
- nature is being exploited relentlessly
- forests are being cut to the ground to create livestock pastures in the middle of the Amazon or to make furniture
  - **old growth wood that took centuries to grow is being turned into furniture that doesn't last a decade!**
- natural life is threatened on every layer of existence
- food resembles poison more than nutrition today
- plants have been devoid of their essence, of their Spirit, and corrupted in order to be turned into *legal* drugs such as alcohol, ciggarates or sugar. Or in other cases into _illegal_ ones such as cocaine.
- the Soil, exhausted from producing yield at the unnatural pace of the modern world, driven by an unnatural and delusional economic system based in exploitation and colonialism has gradually become devoid of nutrients. To counter respond, the last 70 years have seen enormous amounts of chemical fertilizers such as Glyphosate, which in the past years has been linked to [cancer](https://publichealth.gmu.edu/news/2025-06/international-study-reveals-glyphosate-weed-killers-cause-multiple-types-cancer) and [infertility](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40072826/) in humans, yet it keeps being pumped into our soil and thus into the air and our waters to keep up with the hungry mouth of the consumerism that the capitalistic system has created in the first place.
- our energetic and physical bodies are bombarded by invisible interferences ranging from Wifi to 4g/5g/6g technologies to the very light iluminating our public spaces, headlights in newer cars or every shop, commercial center or airport. See this: [National Library of Medicine study](https://news-archive.exeter.ac.uk/featurednews/title_655460_en.html) and this [University of Exter study](https://news-archive.exeter.ac.uk/featurednews/title_655460_en.html).  
  - the incandescent warmth of the old bulbs is being replaced at an alarming rate by cool, artificial and sterile looking lights, in theory to save costs on energy consumption, but in practice it's proven to disrupt the circadian rhythms and provoke other hormonoe disbalances in all mammals, not just humans. See [this article](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/rstb/article/378/1892/20220355/109381/Mitigating-the-impacts-of-street-lighting-on). 
- we're moving from a natural world of inter connectedness to an artificial one where everything exists in seperation and has received a label to be able to be tracked and measured
- the increasing surveilance cameras in towns and big cities
- the higher and higher cost of living
- the global climate changes. No need for sources here–I bet that opening the feed on any social media or news outlet will render a few new tragedies happening just in the last week.
- the increased dependency on technology from smartphones to wearables and of course to AI as a solution to our personal or collective problems
- social media addiction and the fact that they have algorithms and metrics to measure the level of _"addiction"_ or _"desperation"_ of a user and hitting them even harder once they enter that category rather than helping them back to health.
- the trend of hyper individualism
- the promoted ideal that technology is what we need to be saved, like going to Mars and colonizing another planet rather than saving the one we already call home, or even putting a ["Sunlight blocker"](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2025/11/21/stardust-geoengineering-janos-pasztor-regulations-00646414) out in space to counteract the global climate crisis and continue with business as usual, to name a few extreme ones, but unfortunately this happens in the subtlety of day to day life as well, such as using ChatGPT to answer text messages for us or to pick our perfect outfit, as if our human peculiarities, preferences and quarks have suddenly lost all their beauty.
- we are obsessed with perfection and everything needed to be done yesterday (we live in urgency)
- the fact that we forgot how to work with the land
  - how to grow our own food
  - how to build with natural and local materials
- etc...

And the list can go and on...

**But** my point is not just to make a long list of what's wrong in the world and predict doom and gloom. **NO!**
I believe this momementum of energy wrapped in this passion living inside of me is here for more! I believe there is a way to transform. I am optimistic we as a whole can work together to resist the current system, to let it collapse and regroup and rebuild a new one, rooted in _ancient wisdom_ and _modern knowledge_: the New Ancient World as [Doctora Rocio Meza](https://www.drrosalesmeza.com/) is talking about.

I deeply believe that there is a way forward. Once we realize we've been misinformed, lied to and kept in ignorance **on purpose**, so the few can benefit from the privilege to control and manipulate the many, we will rise up and resist.
Yes, this collapse is happening right as we speak. The old system, like a dying beast it's shooting its final blows in desperate attempts to regain its former "glory", but the collapse is happening right now whether we as whole want to admit it or not and the revolution has already begun in humanity's heart.

What we need a lot of is **leaders** who have done the internal work on themselves first and can help others find their own way back home and to freedom. We are all leaders and it's our time now to take back the reigns of our own lives and lead into a world that is free, that is based in truth and is honorable to all life on Earth and beyond, and lastly but not the least to our essence–to the Spirit in all of us and to the Elements that make up this reality.

We are at the point where we need to hug our scared inner children the tightest and heal our transgenerational wounds so we can first find freedom within before we can manifest it without.

We need leaders in every domain possible to lead themselves first and then others. To form groups and communities that are coming back to nature, in right relationship–that is reciprocal relationship where we don't _"take"_ anything because we realized there's no need to, for everything is offered to us when we focus on giving first.

We need to form channels of communication and collaboration between such groups and communities, even at distance using the greatest piece of technology our society invented–[The Internet in its original form](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2019-10-29/internet-50th-anniversary-ucla-kleinrock), to share ideas & solutions and work together in a decentralized fashion. From here we apply the changes and solutions locally only. We all know what our town, village or neighberhood needs–let's start there and trust that once enough of us come together a big transformation will happen organically.

When I say **transformatoin** I don't mean merely improvement. No! I believe we need real transformation from the frequency of the Shadow to the Gift, just like Richard Rudd is teaching in the Gene Keys. That involves real work and effort but it is within our reach. And the rest we live to the Universe, to the Great Spirit, to bring upon our world the Siddhi frequency of Heaven on Earth, because we cannot predict or control when or if it'll happen. We can just do our part, and trust our heart for it knows better than our mind. For this work is about coming to true collaboration and co-creation with that power beyond us–The Divine, that of many names, you can call it whatever you like, regardless of men made religion or science kept in the shadow of limitation and ignorance on purpose out of fear, greed or complacency.

Each of the preseted issues has a counter solution as well. Some can be technological, in fact many can easily be already solved with the technology we already posses as that was proven in the <a href="https://drawdown.org/" target="_blank">Project Draw Down</a> not to be the problem. But the human behavior and addiction to our own suffering and victimization is a bigger problem which keeps us stuck in the loop of consumerism and other coping mechanisms to our internal struggles and conflicts. But even this is a solvable issue once we start seeing the benefits, and luckily people like <a href="https://petercrone.com" target="_blank">Peter Crone</a> have a lot of real impact on this already.

I believe that once the engines in place promoting enslavement of the human Spirit by the means of addiction, artificial poverty, resource scarcity including that of time and overall exploitation of planetary resources including the human ones–as proven recently in an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1q1mzej/im_a_developer_for_a_major_food_delivery_app_the/">whistle blowing article</a> that uncovers the Delivery Industry usage of "human assets" when referring to people–for profits and sheer power will be fought and loved into dissolution the moment of change and transformation is already started and the rest as they say will be history, because without the blocakages and limitations existing to hinder the true potential and spiritual evolution of our race and life on Earth, the collective human organism will find its way back to wholeness and healing just like the body of a single human does.

I believe we are resilient beyond our wildest dreams and we are much more capable and powerful than we got educated to believe. Imagine if we all come together in a cohesive and coherent way, not unlike the bees do, to alchemize these issues! Imagine, literally what we can create when we do that! When we connect our brain to our heart and to our gut and live a life next to other beings that do the same, co-creating, co-dreaming and co-loving together! Just imagine! Take a few seconds to really that bring vision in your body. How does it feel? What becomes possible from there? In the absence of all these constraints, what becomes possible?

Imagine if there was a place that can be accessed both in person and on the Internet where decentralized communities and organizations as well as solo co-creators come together to share, brainstorm and implement ideas with a single coherent goal in mind: to change the current system from the inside out! This is what and why [Moves That Matter].org comes to exist. And this responsibility cannot lie on one persons' shoulders, definitely not mine as I know I will crumble under its weight, nor should it because no matter how powerful, wealthy or smart one person is it takes a whole village to build something long lasting. That is why it's very important to co-laborate in a decentralized manner. Each community implementing changes in their own local environments, thus keeping the focus on the micro, but ideate and think together with everyone in global think tanks, looking at the whole system with an eagle eyes–the macro. I learned these distinction about focusing on the micro while keeping in mind the macro from <a href="https://garyvaynerchuk.com/">Gary Vee</a> and while I don't follow his work for a while now I want to mention him here as he had a strong impact on my growth during my 20s.

Imagine humans from all walks of life coming together for this:
- teachers, guides and mentors
- gardenerers, wisdom keepers and plant enthusiasts
- antrepreneurs, aspirers and artists
- spiritual guides and practitioners on the path
- mothers and fathers
- children and grandparents or seniors
- people that have been isolated or outcasted such as prisoners and the ones locked up in institutions
- artisans and skill workers
- retired people
- and so on...

All coming together to plant the seeds of the New Ancient World, because as the old greek saying goes*, "a society grows great when the old men plant trees in whose shade they shall never sit". *Similarly, we may never get to rest at the cool shade of or labour, but we are here to do it nevertheless, because we have a responsibility to be good ancestors for our children. For they will inherit this Earth and probably what goes beyond it, so the only questions to me are:
  - **What do we want to give to our children?**
  - **What kind of world do we want them to live in?**

I imagine a world where the ancient is paired with the modern in a marriage that will last for centuries if not millenia. One where love dissolves the shackles constructed by the ego and where freedom is the status quo. We are the seed planters of this Ancient New World. Let's do our part!

Are you with me?
