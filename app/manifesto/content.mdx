**I believe the world as we know it is coming to an end.**

And we can choose to do something about it, to mitigate the impact its collapse will have on us.

**Why do I say this?**

Well, among the data points telling me this I list the followings:

- people are obsessed with buying new things.
  (Those things are produced at a mass scale, without real concern for recycling, reusing, repairing or refurbishing them)
- there is a tendency to go big: buy big, build big, drive big
- families of communities of the old generations are almost inexistent nowadays
  - we don't know our neighbors
  - people don't even go out in the villages anymore
- nature is being exploited relentlessly
- forests are being cut to the grount to create livestock pastures in the middle of the Amazon or to make furniture
  - old growth wood that took centuries to grow is being turned into furnuitre that doesn't last a decade
- natural life is threatened on every layer of existence
- food resembles poision more than nuturion today
- plants have been devoid of their essence, of their Spirit, and corrupted in order to be turned into **legal** drugs such as alcohol, ciggarates or sugar. Or in other cases into _illigal_ ones such as cocaine.
- the Soil, exhausted from producing yield at the unnatural pace of the modern world, driven by an unnatural and delusional economic system based in exploitation and colonialism has gradually become devoid of nutrients. To counter respond the last 70 years have seen enormous amounts of chemical fertilizers such as glasphosphates, which in the past years has been linked to cancer and infertility in humans, yet it keeps being pumped into our soil and thus into the air and our waters to keep up with the hungry mouth of the consumerism that the capitalistic system has created in the first place.
- or energetic and physical bodies are bombarded by invisible interferences ranging from Wifi to 4g/5g/6g technologies to the very light illumiinating our public spaces, our car headlights or every shop, commercial center or airport. _**[link to source]**_
  - the incandescent warmth of the old bulbs is being replaced at an alarming rate by cool, artificial and sterile looking lights, in theory to save costs on energy consumption, but in practice it's proven to disrupt the circadian rhythms and provoke other hormonoe disbalances in all mammals, not just humans. _**[link to source]**_
- we're moving from a natural world of inter connectedness to an artificial one where everything exists in seperation and has received a label to be able to be tracked and measured
- the increasing surveilance cameras in towns and big cities
- the higher and higher cost of living
- the global climate changes. No need for sources here–I bet that opening the feen on any social media or news outlet will render a few new tragedies happening just in the last week.
- the increased dependency on technology from smartphones to wearables and of course to AI as a solution to our personal or collective problems
- social media addiction and the fact that they have algorithms and metrics to measure the level of _"addiction"_ or _"desperation"_ of a user and hitting them even harder once they enter that category rather than helping them back to healing.
- the trend of hyper individualism
- the promoted ideal that technology is what we need to be saved like going to Mars and colonizing another planet rather than saving the one we already call home _**[link to source]**_, or even putting a "Sunlight blocker" out in space to counteract the global climate crisis and continue with business as usual***[link to source]*** to name a few extreme ones, but unfortunately this happens in the subtlety of day to day life as well, such as using ChatGPT to answer text messages for us or to pick our perfect outfit, as if our human peculiatities and preferences and quarks have suddenly lost all the beauty.
- we are obsessed with perfection and everything needed to be done yesterday (we live in urgency)
- the fact that we forgot how to work with the land
  - how to grow our own food
  - how to build with natural and local materials

And the list can go and on...

**But** my point is not just to make a long list of what's wrong in the world and predict doom and gloom. **NO!**
I believe this momementul of wnergy wrapped in this passion living in me is here for more! I believe there is a way to transform. I am optimistic we as a whole can work together to resist the current system, to let it collapse and regroup and rebuild a new one, rooted in _anceient wisdom_ and _modern knowledge_, the New Ancient World as Doctora Rocio Meza is talking about.

I deeply believe that there is a way forward.
